    "This data is of flagged and unflagged tweets from the social media monitoring technology Social Sentinel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Social Sentinel is an service sold to schools which scans social media messages which tries to detect threats of violence or self-harm. The company has said in the past that it scans more than a billion posts on social media every day against more than 450,000 words and phrases in its “Language of Harm.” \n",
    "\n",
    "So far as I can tell from publicly-available documents and news articles, Social Sentinel’s system consists of two pieces:<ol>  \n",
    "<li>An nlp classifier system that detects potentially threatening messages posted to social media</li>\n",
    "<li>Keywords inputted by the school which connect a given threatening post to a client college.</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to other data I obtained, Social Sentinel has been used by at least 37 colleges in the past six years, 32 of which are public. (UCLA may or may not have purchased the service in late 2016). This number is quite small when compared to the hundreds of K12 school districts which have used the service over the same time period, but not insignificant. Some of the country’s largest and most well-known colleges have used Social Sentinel, including UNC-Chapel Hill, the University of Virginia, Michigan State University, MIT and Arizona State University.\n",
    "    \n",
    "There is mounting evdience that Social Sentinel is not only being used to stop suicides and shootings, but for suppressing activism and protests as well. For more on this read the following stories, which I authored:<ol>\n",
    "    <li><a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2021/09/02/texas-schools-are-watching-millions-of-students-online-often-without-their-knowledge-or-consent/\">Texas schools are surveilling students online, often without their knowledge or consent</a></li>\n",
    "    <li><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/unc-campus-police-used-geofencing-tech-monitor-antiracism-protestors-n1105746\">UNC campus police used geofencing tech to monitor antiracism protestors</a></li></ol>       \n",
    "        \n",
    "The data used here comes from two sources:<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Public records obtained by Buzzfeed News reporter's Peter Aldhous and Lam Vo, which were parsed from PDFs, MSGs and EMLs into RData, then exported as CSVs and given to me.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Tweets from the same time period from the same users who have flagged tweets from the Buzzfeed dataset, which were scraped using the Twint package.</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are in two columns \"content\", which is the actual tweet itself and \"flagged\", which is encoded as a binary 0 (for no ie. the tweet wasn't  classified as a potential threat by Social Sentinel) and 1 (for yes, ie. the tweet was classified as a threat by Social Sentinel). "
