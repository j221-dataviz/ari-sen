http://contrahoax.blogspot.com/2017/12/student-in-hobbs-high-school-
shooting_19.htmlHOBBS, N.M. (AP) - A Hobbs High School student may face charges after
authorities say he used a school computer to spread a hoax about a pending school
shooting.The Hobbs News-Sun reports the student, whose name hasn't been released, recently
was disciplined for creating the hoax days after a gunman killed two students at Aztec High
School.Officials say disciplinary measures were also taken against two other Hobbs students who
used their cell phones to photograph the computer screen hoax and then circulated it on their
Snapchat social media accounts.Rumors of the Hobbs High School shooting sparked around 200
parents to pick up their students early last week.Hobbs High School Principal Zeke Kaney says
officials take all threats seriously.Information from: Hobbs News-Sun, Copyright 2017 The
